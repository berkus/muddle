"""VersionStamp and stamp file support.

Stamp files
===========
Stamp files are INI files, implemented using the Python ConfigParser module
(specifically, RawConfigParser).

INI files are composed of one or more sections, each of the form::

    [header]
    key = value
    key = value

Indentation is allowed, but will be ignored.

Comment lines may be introduced with either '#' or ';', and in-line comments
may be added by following '[header]' or 'key = value' with whitespace and a
';' (but not a '#').

Muddle treats '#' comment lines specially in stamp files, but is not aware
of ';' comments, and we recommend not using them in muddle stamp files.

When a stamp file is written or read, a SHA1 hash is calculated from the lines
of text being written/read. Since mid-July 2012, comment lines starting with
'#', and blank lines (whitespace only) are not included in that SHA1 hash.
Since a stamp file uniquely describes the current state of a muddle build tree,
the hash calculated from its content can be regarded as a version id for the
build tree.

It can sometimes be useful to edit a stamp file. If you do so, it is advisable
to add a comment or comments indicating what has been done and why.

All muddle commands for handling stamp files are subcommands of either "muddle
stamp" or "muddle unstamp".

Version 1 Stamp Files
---------------------
We retain limited support for version 1 stamp files, mainly to allow reading
existing (legacy) files. There *is* provision for writing version 1 stamp
files, but it is not guaranteed to be accurate.

Version 1 stamp files were replaced because they could not unambiguously
store all of the information needed by the Repository class we now use to
remember where a checkout "came from".

Support for version 1 stamp files will be removed at some future time.

Version 2 Stamp Files
---------------------
Version 2 stamp files are the current form of stamp file.

This section describes the current content of a stamp file, as currently
written by muddle. For the rest of this section, "stamp files" should be taken
to mean "version 2 stamp files".

All stamp files start with some standard comment lines::

    # Muddle stamp file
    # Written at 2012-07-12 13:13:13
    #            2012-07-12 12:13:13 UTC

The date and time stamps are in local time and UTC respectively.

This is followed by a general section::

    [STAMP]
    version = 2

which at the moment just identifies the version of the stamp file.

Next comes a section identifying the build description - this repeats
information taken from the RootRepository, Description and VersionsRepository
files in the ``.muddle/`` directory of the build. For instance::

  [ROOT]
  repository = git+ssh://git@palmera.c//opt/kynesim/projects/001
  description = builds/01.py
  versions_repo = git+file:///home/tibs/temp/r/versions

and, if "muddle init -branch" was originally used, also the DescriptionBranch
file::

  [ROOT]
  repository = git+ssh://git@palmera.c//opt/kynesim/projects/001
  description = builds/01.py
  description_branch = test-v0.1
  versions_repo = git+file:///home/tibs/temp/r/versions

The keys ('repository', etc.) are always presented in the same order - this is
a general principle within stamp file sections, so that stamp files themselves
can be comparable with simple tools such as ``diff``.

Next, if the build tree has subdomains, will come sections describing those
domains. For instance::

    [DOMAIN subdomain1]
    description = builds/01.py
    name = subdomain1
    repository = git+file:///home/tibs/sw/muddle/tests/transient/repo/subdomain1

    [DOMAIN subdomain1(subdomain3)]
    description = builds/01.py
    name = subdomain1(subdomain3)
    repository = git+file:///home/tibs/sw/muddle/tests/transient/repo/subdomain3

Domain sections occur in "C" sort order of the domain names. Note that there
will not be any domain sections if there are no subdomains (i.e., if there is
no ``domains/`` directory in the build tree).

.. note:: The [DOMAIN] sections do not record a 'description_branch' for each
   subdomain. We do not currently support specifying a particular branch for
   the subdomain build description in the same manner as is done at the top
   level with "muddle init -branch".

Next come sections for each checkout. For instance::

    [CHECKOUT (subdomain1)builds]
    co_label = checkout:(subdomain1)builds/checked_out
    co_leaf = builds
    repo_vcs = git
    repo_from_url_string = None
    repo_base_url = file:///home/tibs/sw/muddle/tests/transient/repo/subdomain1
    repo_name = builds
    repo_prefix_as_is = False
    repo_revision = 7d8377a18efcd8b3d7b788de8cee26aa6d770005

and::

    [CHECKOUT builds]
    co_label = checkout:builds/checked_out
    co_leaf = builds
    repo_vcs = git
    repo_from_url_string = None
    repo_base_url = ssh://git@palmera.c//opt/kynesim/projects/001
    repo_name = builds
    repo_prefix_as_is = False
    repo_revision = dfb06f29c81828bbdfc48ce53d7bc4203b68a459

    [CHECKOUT busybox-1.17.1]
    co_label = checkout:busybox-1.17.1/checked_out
    co_dir = linux
    co_leaf = busybox-1.17.1
    repo_vcs = git
    repo_from_url_string = None
    repo_base_url = ssh://git@palmera.c//opt/kynesim/projects/001
    repo_name = busybox-1.17.1
    repo_prefix = linux
    repo_prefix_as_is = False
    repo_revision = 965b4809b5ca93df0a4973e043a5a9af0ecf50e3
    repo_branch = issue99-fix

The values presented give the checkout label, its location in the build tree
('co_dir' and 'co_leaf'), and its Repository instance (the 'repo_xxx' values.
See "muddle doc version_control.checkout_from_repo" for some information on
how the 'co_xxx' values are used, and "muddle doc repository.Repository" for
more information on the Repository class).

.. note:: The 'repo_revision' is the current revision of the checkout, and
   'repo_branch' is its current branch if that is not "master", and if the
   VCS for the checkout supports setting branches.

Again, these are presented in "C" sort order of the checkout name, including
the domain component - this means that subdomain checkouts will occur before
toplevel checkouts. Also, while not all checkout sections will contain the
same values, the order in which they are presented will always be the same.

Finally, if "muddle stamp" reported any problems in creating the stamp file,
these will be saved in a problems section. For instance::

    [PROBLEMS]
    problem1 = builds: 'svnversion' reports checkout has revision '459M'

(a subversion revision ending in 'M' means that the checkout was modified and
not yet committed). Problems are presented as 'problem1', 'problem2', etc. In
general, the checkout name should be the first part of the message occurring as
the problem value.

Release stamp files
-------------------
Release stamp files are an extension of normal stamp files that also specify
a release. As such, they have an extra section (after the ``[STAMP]`` section)
of the form::

    [RELEASE]
    name = project99
    version = 1.2.3
    archive = tar
    compression = gzip

This indicates that the rest of the stamp file describes a release called (or
for) "project99", and that it is version 1.2.3. The release will be archived
using tar, and the tar file will be compressed using gzip.

Both the ``name`` and ``version`` specified must start with an ASCII
alphanumeric, and may only contain ASCII alphanumerics, and the characters '.',
'-' or '_'. For instance::

    version = v1-2.11
    version = xvii
    version = 0.9.3alpha1

The ``archive`` value must currently be ``tar`` - other values may perhaps be
allowed in the future.

The ``compression`` value must be either ``gzip`` or ``bzip2``.

Note that any release stamp file can be read as a "normal" stamp file - the
extra release-specific information will just be ignored.

        'builder' is the muddle Builder for our build description.

        If 'force' is true, then attempt to "force" a revision id, even if it
        is not necessarily correct. For instance, if a local working directory
        contains uncommitted changes, then ignore this and use the revision id
        of the committed data. If it is actually impossible to determine a
        sensible revision id, then use the revision specified by the build
        description (which defaults to HEAD). For really serious problems, this
        may refuse to guess a revision id.

            (Typical use of this is expected to be when a trying to calculate a
            stamp reports problems in particular checkouts, but inspection
            shows that these are artefacts that may be ignored, such as an
            executable built in the source directory.)

        If 'just_use_head' is true, then HEAD will be used for all checkouts.
        In this case, the repository specified in the build description is
        used, and the revision id and status of each checkout is not checked.

        If 'before' is given, it should be a string describing a date/time, and
        the revision id chosen for each checkout will be the last revision
        at or before that date/time.

        .. note:: This depends upon what the VCS concerned actually supports.
           This feature is experimental.

    'archive' and 'compression' may be set to None or a value from the
    'allowed_' lists. If they are set to None, they in fact get set to the
    first 'allowed_' value, so this is a simple way of selecting the default.
