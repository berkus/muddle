    """
    A label denotes an entity in muddle's dependency hierarchy.

    A label is structured as::

            <type>:<name>{<role>}/<tag>[<flags>]

    or::

            <type>:(<domain>)<name>{<role>}/<tag>[<flags>]

    The <type>, <name>, <role> and <tag> parts are composed of the characters
    [A-Za-z0-9-+_], or the wildcard character '*'.

    The <domain> name is composed of the same plus '(' and ')'.

    The domain, role and flags are all optional.

        .. note:: The label strings "type:name/tag" and "type:name{}/tag[]" are
           identical, although the former is the more usual form.)

           The '+' is allowed in label parts to allow for names like "g++".

           Domains are used when relating sub-builds to each other, and are
           not necessary when relating labels within the same build. It is
           not allowed to specify the empty domain as "()" - just omit the
           parentheses.

           If necessary "sub-domains" are specified using nested domains -- for
           instance::

                (outer)
                (outer(inner))
                (outer(inner(even.innerer)))

           This is intended to be unambiguous rather than pretty.

           Note that wildcarding of a domain name currently only supports one
           level (i.e., the top "(*)"), and not wildcarding of nested domains.

           If you do find yourself using multi-level domains, we would strongly
           suggest reconsidering your overall build design.

    The "core" part of a label is the ``<name>{<role>}`` or
    ``(<domain>)<name>{<role>}``. The <type> and <tag> can (typically) be
    thought of as tracking the progress of the "core" entity through its
    lifecycle (build sequence, etc.).

    Names beginning with an underscore are reserved by muddle, so do not use
    them for other purposes.

        (Why is the 'domain' argument at the end of the argument list? Because
        it was added after the other arguments were already well-established,
        and some uses of Label use positional arguments.)

    Label instances are treated as immutable by the muddle system, although the
    implementation does not currently enforce this. Please don't try to abuse
    this, as Bad Things will happen.

    .. note:: The *flags* on a label are not immutable, and are regarded as
              transient annotations.

    .. note:: When a domain is included as a subdomain, all of its labels are
              "adjusted" to have the new, appropriate domain name. This is
              clearly a special meaning of the word "immutable". However, it
              should only be the muddle system itself doing this.

              Because of this (potential change in content of a label), the
              domain name does not contribute to a label's hash value. Thus
              a label that whose domain name is changed will continue to
              work as the same key in a dictionary (for instance).

        :type:      What kind of label this is. The standard muddle values are
                    "checkout", "package" and "deployment". These values are
                    defined programmatically via muddled.utils.LabelType.
                    Thus the 'type' is conventionally used to indicate what
                    general "stage" of the build process a label belongs to.
        :name:      The name of this checkout/package/whatever. This should be
                    a useful mnemonic for the labels purpose.
        :role:      The role for this checkout/package/whatever. A role might
                    delimit the target architecture of the labels it is used
                    in (roles such as "x86", "arm", "beagleboard"), or the
                    sort of purpose ("role" in the more traditionale sense,
                    such as "boot", "firmware", "packages"), or some other
                    useful delineation of a partition in the general label
                    namespace (thinking of labels as points in an N-dimensional
                    space).
        :tag:       A tag indicating more precisely what stage the label
                    belongs to within each 'type'. There are different
                    conventional values according to the 'type' of the label
                    (for instance, "checked_out", "built", "installed", etc.).
                    These values are defined programmatically via
                    muddled.utils.LabelTag.
        :transient: If true, changes to this tag will not be persistent in
                    the muddle database. 'transient' is used to denote
                    something which will go away when muddle is terminated -
                    e.g. environment variables.
        :system:    If true, marks this label as a system label and not to be
                    reported (by 'muddle depend') unless asked for. System labels
                    are labels "invented" by muddle itself to satisfy implicit
                    dependencies, or to allow the build system as a whole to
                    work.
        :domain:    The domain is used to specify which build or sub-build this
                    label corresponds to. Nested "tail recursive" parenthesised
                    components may be used to specify sub-domains (but this is
                    not recommended). The domain defaults to the current build.

        The role may be None, indicating (for instance) that roles are not
        relevant to this particular label.

        The domain may be None, indicating that the label belongs to the
        current build. If the domain is given as '' (empty string) then this
        is equivalent to None, and is stored as such. Do not specify domains
        unless you need to.

        The kind, name, role and tag may be wildcarded, by being set to '*'.
        When evaluating dependencies between labels, for instance, a wildcard
        indicates "for any value of this part of the label".

        Domains can be wildcarded, and that probably means the obvious (that
        the label applies across all domains), but this may not yet be
        implemented. Wildcarding of sub-domains may never be supported.

        Note that label flags (including specifically 'transient' and 'system')
        are not equality-preserving properties of a label - two labels are not
        made unequal just because they have different flags.

        (In fact, no two labels should ever have different values for
        transience, for obvious reasons, and the system flag is intended only
        to limit over-reporting of information.)

        For instance:

            >>> Label('package', 'busybox')
            Label('package', 'busybox', role=None, tag='*')
            >>> str(_)
            'package:busybox/*'
            >>> Label('package', 'busybox', tag='installed')
            Label('package', 'busybox', role=None, tag='installed')
            >>> str(_)
            'package:busybox/installed'
            >>> Label('package', 'busybox', role='rootfs', tag='installed')
            Label('package', 'busybox', role='rootfs', tag='installed')
            >>> str(_)
            'package:busybox{rootfs}/installed'
            >>> Label('package', 'busybox', 'rootfs', 'installed')
            Label('package', 'busybox', role='rootfs', tag='installed')
            >>> str(_)
            'package:busybox{rootfs}/installed'
            >>> Label('package', 'busybox', role='rootfs', tag='installed', domain="arm.helloworld")
            Label('package', 'busybox', role='rootfs', tag='installed', domain='arm.helloworld')
